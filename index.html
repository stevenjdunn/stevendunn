							<p>Hi, I'm Steven. I'm a researcher with <strong>8 years of experience</strong> in the microbial genomics field, and a passion for high quality research, visual design, and developing people.</p>
							<p>My research interests revolve around the <strong>evolutionary genomics</strong> of <strong>antimicrobial resistance</strong> and its hosts, and I am particularly interested in <strong>clinically prevalent MDR organisms</strong> like <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Klebsiella.</i></p>
							<p>Got a cool dataset? Think I'd be a good fit for a job?</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>After finishing my PhD, I have been working as a postdoctoral research fellow in the <a href="https://twitter.com/alanmcn1">McNally lab</a> at the university of Birmingham.</p>
							<p>But I've also had the chance to do other things, including consultancy work covering bioinformatics and figure design.</p>
							<p> I always throw my self head-first into new projects and roles, and any job that has problem solving and teamwork at its core is a job I would thrive in.</p>

										<h3>Postdoctoral Researcher, University Of Birmingham</h3>
										<p>2017 - Present</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p> My work at the Institute of Microbiology and Infection has mainly focussed on the <strong>evolutionary mechanisms</strong> underpinning AMR dissemination in <strong>MDR <i>E. coli</i></strong>. This BBSRC funded work introduced a CTX-M-15 bearing plasmid to a range of ESBL-naive <i>E. coli</i>, and followed up by looking at the <strong>genomic</strong> and <strong>transcriptomic</strong> impact of that plasmid aquisition.</p>
										<p>You can check out our paper on <a href="https://msystems.asm.org/content/6/2/e00083-21">that here.</a></p>
										<p>We then developed this further by putting these hosts through <strong>600 generations</strong> of experimental growth. We saw a number of <strong>parallel variations</strong> occuring, both in the same gene or position, as well as the same operon or pathway. A lot of variation was driven by IS movement.</p>
										<p>I also had the opportunity to work on many <strong>diverse and enjoyable side projects</strong>, one of the works I am most proud of is a study looking at a cohort of international travellers. We took daily stool samples to investigate the dynamics of intestinal colonisation. And it is <strong><i>dynamic</i></strong>.</p>
										<p>You can find the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30224-X/fulltext">paper on that work here</a>, or check out this lightning talk I made for ABPHM21.</p>

										<p>Of course, I worked alongside many other great postdocs and PhD students, and had the pleasure of helping to supervise some really excellent projects. It's through this often underappreciated aspect of postdoc work that I really found my <strong>affinity for helping others</strong>. I love my job, and a large part of that is being able to bring other people up - teaching them to do something they think is impossible, or showing them a new way to achieve something in a 10th of the time, or just giving them feedback and seeing their confidence and abilities grow. This is a large part of my motivation to work in academia, and something I want to develop further as I continue through my career</p>
										<p>Another highlight of my time at the University of Birmingham was running a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AMGD2020?src=hashtag_click">week long CPD crash-course</a> on microbial genomic analysis. I designed and delivered the curriculum and materials, including a detailed handbook that took people right from using bash, to generating complex annotated phylogenies. The course was a huge success, receiving very high feedback, and a second round sold out in a few days. Unfortunately, this was around the time of the pandemic, but I hope to continue this in the not-too-distant future.</p>

										<p>2020 - 2021</p>

										<h3>COVID-19 Laboratory Technician, Medicines Discovery Catapult</h3>
										<p>2020 - 2020</p>

										<p>The pandemic was a period of uncertainty and strife for all of us, and adjusting to this was a great challenge. Fortunately, I was to be able to offer my experience as a scientist to help the COVID-19 testing efforts, which helped immensely with my own adjustment and mental health during such a strange time.</p>
										<p>This began in the early phases of the pandemic by working as a laboratory technician responsible for the <strong>high-throughput processing</strong> of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-data-methodology/covid-19-testing-data-methodology-note">Pillar-2</a> PCR swabs. This was based out of Alderley Park, a beautiful research hub based in Macclesfield, and managed by many of the park's excellent staff from companies like Astra Zeneca. Macclesfield is quite the commute from my house, and I would often stay overnight at Manchester Airport, which was eerily deserted.</p>
										<p>As the UK developed its response and validated lateral flow tests for asymptomatic diagnostics, I was assigned to <strong>manage the asymptomatic test site</strong>, housed in The University of Birmingham's Great Hall. This was an incredible feat, orchestrated by many excellent people within the organisation, and allowed us to mass screen our student population before they returned home to their loved ones over the 2020 holiday period.</p>

										<p> We continued offering this testing to all students and staff in 2021, and we also produced a research paper that showed that the tests we were using picked up individuals with high CT-values <a href="https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001216">very reliably.</a></p>

										<h3>Hourly Paid Lecturer, Nottingham Trent University</h3>
										<p>2013 - 2017</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>During my PhD, I helped to run the practical undergraduate lab sessions. Halfway through, NTU completed their <i>superlab</i>, which made use of a lot of novel technology for delivering many classes at once.</p>
										<p>It was always great fun, and I had the opportunity to meet and teach a wide variety of undergradutes from many different disciplines.</p>
